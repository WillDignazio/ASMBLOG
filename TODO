- A thing that really needs to be added in is a method of parsing a configuration 
  file. This could pretty easily be tied in with whatever mechanism is built to 
  dynamically built in commands. i.e. $POST1$ would post the contents of the first 
  post.

- Another problem is the GET'ing method FCGI, which if I say request 
  css/default.css, it will only return what it is programmed to. In this
  case, since their is no REST api, will just return the only thing the 
  blog can handle, the root data. A TODO is make custom handlers for CSS 
  and other documents, this should basically be a REST api. Sounds fun.

- I realized that the serve_header method (html.asm) used to only serve the
  content once, this is because it would print the lines sequentially while 
  reading the file and then it's done. This was changed so that at every time
  you navigate to the webpage, the file is re-read and then displayed as it 
  would the first time. This has advantages, like being able to edit the
  webpage without bringing the site down, and disadvantages, like slower data
  recieve times. A TODO is for a way to dynamically allocate memory for the 
  header and recognize when changes are made so it can be reloaded (inotify).
